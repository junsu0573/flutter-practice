# Contributing

_See also: [Flutter's code of conduct](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)_

Want to contribute to the Flutter codelabs ecosystem? Great! First, read this
page (including the small print at the end).

## Is this the right place for your contribution?

This repo is used by members of the Flutter Developer Relations team 
as a place to store code for our codelabs, on both
[docs.flutter.dev](https://docs.flutter.dev/codelabs) and
[codelabs.developer.google.com](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/).

## So what should be contributed here, then?

Fixes and necessary improvements to the existing codelabs, mostly.

## Before you contribute

Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License
Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.

one above, the [Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License
Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).
