# Review

Congrats, you've done it! While it might have appeared simple at first, 
hopefully you've enjoyed the "Button Challenge." Along the way, you've learned
how to:

  1. Create a new type of Widget, both stateless and stateful
  2. Worked with callback functions to handle taps, clicks, and keyboard
     navigation
  3. Make the widget configurable with instance variables and constructor
     parameters
  4. Made it accessible with the `Semantics` widget
  5. Cleaned it all up with the `FocusableActionDetector` widget
