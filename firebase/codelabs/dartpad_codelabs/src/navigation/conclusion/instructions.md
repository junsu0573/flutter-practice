# Conclusion

Congrats! You've completed the workshop on Navigation. At this point, you've
learned how to:

  1. Work with Tabs to navigate between related content
  2. Use Navigation Bars to navigate between different destinations in your app
  3. Launched new screens with the Navigator
  4. Created a routing system that allows you to extract information from path
     names and pass the information to your widgets.
  5. Made all of it look fancy with custom animations!

That's a lot to tackle. Good job :)
