# Conclusion

Nice work! Throughout this workshop, you've learned how to display lists and
grids of content. You've learned how to display small lists of items, and how
to use builders to make long lists and grids efficient.

You've also learned how to extract your own widgets. Not only can it make your
code easier to read, it also allows you to reuse the same widgets throughout
your app.

At this point, you have all the tools you need to create beautiful lists of
content in Flutter. Now, you can make your own music app with playlists, email
app with lists of messages, or social media app with a feed of photos!
