# Completion

Congratulations! üëç You have reached the end of the workshop.

In this workshop we 

- learned how to build scroll views efficiently, using lazy loading for our scrollable
- converted our scroll view to work directly with slivers
- explored the `SliverAppBar` and how it is complimented
by the `FlexibleSpaceBar` widget.

There are a lot more slivers to explore, like `SliverGrid` and
`SliverPadding`. Many are the sliver versions of common box widgets,
like:

| Box Widget | Sliver Widget |
|---|---|
| ListView  | SliverList |
| GridView | SliverGrid |
| Padding | SliverPadding |
| AnimatedList | SliverAnimatedList |
| FadeTransition | SliverFadeTransition |
| IgnorePointer | SliverIgnorePointer |

All sliver widgets are prefixed with `Sliver`.
