# Conclusion

Congrats -- you've completed the workshop on Material Design with Flutter! You
started out learning about design systems, then took a tour of several Material
Design widgets Flutter offers out of the box.

Always remember: Flutter is a flexible framework. You can build your own design
system and implement it with Flutter widgets. However, if you want to quickly
prototype an application, or if your team makes the choice to follow the
Material Design spec, Flutter provides tons of widgets out of the box.

## Next Steps

  1. Read all about [Material Design](https://material.io/)
  2. Visit the [Material Widget
     Catalog](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets/material) to see
     all available material widgets
