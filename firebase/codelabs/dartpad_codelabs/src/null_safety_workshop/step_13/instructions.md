# Late and lazy
Another pattern that `late` can help with is lazy initialization for expensive,
non-nullable fields. 

## Exercise
Try this:

* Run this code without changing it, and note the output.
* Think: What will change if you make _cache a late field?
* Make _cache a late field, and run the code. Was your prediction correct?
