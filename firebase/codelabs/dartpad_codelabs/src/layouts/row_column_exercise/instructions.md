# Exercise: Rows & Columns

Phew -- that was a lot of information. Now, it's time to have some fun and code!
In the next two steps, your goal is to break down a design and convert it into a
Flutter app.

The first challenge: Using your knowledge of `Row` and `Column` widgets,
implement the following design. You may use any landscape image and text that
makes sense. 

<img 
  alt="The finished app" 
  src="https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/ui/layout/lakes.jpg" 
  style="width: 50%" 
/>

Note: If you need a bit more help understanding how to break this layout down,
please take a look at the [tutorial on how to build this
layout](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/layout/tutorial).
